 -  Autosuggestions save keystrokes, particularly for mobile applications.
 -  Synonyms of query terms must be recognized.
 - Documents containing linguistic variations of query terms must be matched.
 - Phrase handling is needed; that is, does the user want documents matching all words or any of the words in a phrase.

properly. 

 - The user must have a way to see more results if the top results aren’t satisfactory
